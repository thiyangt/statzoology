# Primary vs Secondary Data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Primary Data

-   Primary data refers to information collected directly by the researcher.

-   This data is gathered specifically to address the researcher’s current problem or objective, tailored to meet the specific requirements of a particular study.

## Secondary Data

-   Secondary data refers to information that has already been collected, compiled, and published by others for purposes different from the researcher’s current study.

## Methods of collecting primary data

# Observational Studies vs Experimental Study

# Observational Studies vs Experimental Study: Examples

Investigate the effect of fertilizer A and B on chili crop yield.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Researcher 1

**Step 1:** Population: Identify two groups of chili farmers based on the fertilizer they use.

Group A: Farmers using fertilizer A.

Group B: Farmers using fertilizer B.

**Step 2:** Data collection: Collect data on chili crop yield from both groups at the end of the growing season.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Researcher 2

**Step 1:** Randomization: Randomly assign plots of land to receive either fertilizer A or fertilizer B. Same seed variety is used.

**Step 2:** Control Conditions: Ensure all other conditions (water, sunlight, humidity, soil type) are kept constant across all plots. Use consistent pest management practices and ensure uniform planting and harvesting techniques.

**Step 3:** Data Collection: Measure the chili crop yield from each plot at the end of the growing season.

## Methods of collecting secondary data

-   Online databases: These databases can be categorized into two main types based on their accessibility: commercial and open-access.

> Ex: Department of Census and Statistics website: http://www.statistics.gov.lk/#gsc.tab=0

> Ex: Open-access: Dengue data hub: https://denguedatahub.netlify.app/

-   Government and Institutional Reports

> Ex: Annual Report, Central Bank of Sri Lanka

## Methods of collecting secondary data (cont.)

-   **Commercial Data:** Purchasing or accessing data from commercial sources like market research firms, industry reports, and business analytics services

-   **Census and Public Records:** Using demographic data, economic statistics, and other information from national censuses and public records maintained by government agencies.

-   **Media Archives:** Reviewing newspapers, magazines, television broadcasts, and other media sources for relevant historical data and trends.

## Methods of collecting secondary data (cont.)

-   **Internal Company Records:** Examining an organization's internal reports, financial statements, sales records, and other documents for business research purposes.

-   **Libraries and Archives:** Visiting physical or digital libraries and archives to access a wide range of historical documents, manuscripts, and archival records.

-   **Meta-Analysis:** Synthesizing data from multiple studies to draw broader conclusions, often used in scientific and medical research.

## Why Secondary Data?

1.  Cost-Effective (not always)

2.  Time-Saving

3.  Preliminary Research: It serves as a valuable resource for preliminary research or background studies, helping to identify gaps in knowledge, formulate hypotheses, and refine research questions.

4.  Historical Analysis: Enables researchers to conduct historical analyses and understand past trends, events, and behaviors, which can inform present and future research directions.

5.  Validation: Secondary data can be used to validate findings from primary data

Find advatages and disadvatages of using primary and secondary data.

# True or False?

## Question 1

In an observational study, researchers directly intervene and manipulate variables to observe their effects on the outcome.

```{r}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00)
```

## Question 2

The sample in a study refers to the entire group of individuals or objects that researchers want to study.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00)
```

## Question 3

Descriptive statistics are used to make inferences and predictions about a population based on sample data.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00)
```

## Question 4

Inferential statistics are used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00)
```

## Question 5

The sample in a study represents the entire group of individuals or objects that researchers want to study.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00)
```

## Question 6

Descriptive statistics are used to make predictions about a population based on sample data.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00)
```

## Question 7

If there is no data, statistical analysis can still be performed based on theoretical assumptions.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00)
```

## Question 8

Primary data is collected through methods such as surveys, interviews, and experiments.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00)
```

## Question 9

Primary data collection allows researchers to have more control over the data quality and reliability.

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00)
```

## Question 10

Secondary data sources may include government databases, archival records, and proprietary datasets.

```{r, fig.height=4}
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00)
```
